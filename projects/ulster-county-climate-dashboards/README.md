# Climate Corps Dashboards for Ulster County Government

**By Adam Koplik**

## Overview  
During the summer of 2023, I worked as a Climate Data Intern for Ulster County Government. I was responsible for developing a series of ArcGIS dashboards and web tools to help visualize climate-related data for public policy initiatives. I also led a small team of interns, tracked their project progress, and consolidated their work into a public-facing website to improve the visibility of county-wide climate programs.

## Project Scope  

- Developed a **Climate Corps Dashboard** website to showcase multiple intern-led climate data projects.
- Built several interactive **ArcGIS dashboards** visualizing key climate-related and public health datasets, including:
  - Disadvantaged communities map  
  - Healthcare desert analysis  
  - Population vulnerability by census tract  
- Managed a team of interns, organized weekly check-ins, and compiled their deliverables into a polished, navigable online resource for the public and local government officials.
- Contributed to public outreach by presenting dashboard demos to county departments and participating in community climate action briefings.

## Tools and Technologies  

- ArcGIS Online  
- ArcGIS Dashboards  
- HTML, CSS (for website layout)  
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning and prep)  
- Google Sheets and Google Docs (project tracking)

## Key Results  

- Delivered a centralized **Climate Corps Dashboard website** consolidating multiple data visualization projects for Ulster County.
- Created clean, accessible maps and dashboards to highlight priority public health and environmental justice issues within the county.
- Increased public awareness and internal visibility of climate data initiatives through interactive tools and presentations.
- Established a sustainable framework for future intern cohorts to expand and add projects.

## Takeaways  

This role gave me hands-on experience working in local government data operations, team leadership, and public sector data visualization. It improved my skills in project management, dashboard development, and communicating complex data to non-technical audiences.
