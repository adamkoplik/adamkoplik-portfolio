    "title": "The New Book Burning: Banning Critical Race Theory",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The New Book Burning: Banning Critical Race Theory\nWritten for EDUC-102: Issues in Education with Prof. Chenyu Wang on 12/7/2021\nEvery few years, it seems like both American political parties come up with new buzzwords. In 2016 it was “emails”, in 2018 it was “caravan”, and in 2020 it was “freedom”. Now, Republicans across the country have come up with a new term to frighten their constituents: “Critical Race Theory” (CRT).\nAccording to Education Week, a nonpartisan news organization covering K-12 education, critical race theory is an academic idea “that race is a social construct, and that racism is not merely the product of individual bias or prejudice, but also something embedded in legal systems and policies.” (Sawchuk). At its core, critical race theory looks to educate students about the systemic injustices present in America and its history. Critical race theory studies actions like school segregation, redlining, and gerrymandering that have had long lasting effects on systemic oppression despite it being decades since the Civil Rights Act passed.\nHowever, some conservatives have conflated critical race theory with ALL social justice movements–similarly to how they conflated all the police brutality protests with Black Lives Matter–and have used it as a buzzword to signal that something is “woke” and therefore bad. From diversity training to “cancel culture”, some conservatives worldwide believe that the heart of critical race theory is not learning about our dark history, but simply blaming all white people for the past actions of the nation. Just look at this tweet from former British National Party leader Nick Griffin (also, crop your memes, dude):\nhttps://twitter.com/NickGriffinBU/status/1467989827115233288\nIn the tweet, Griffin post a picture of a brown bear, black bear, and polar bear, with text underneath stating, “BROWN BEAR”, “BLACK BEAR”, and “RACIST BEAR”, captioned “Critical race theory. The actual #racism afflicting the death pangs of liberalism.” This is a common criticism of critical race theory, saying it is racist against white people and simply asks white people to take responsibility for racism.\nThis is unfounded. White people are not being asked to apologize for systemic oppression, simply to acknowledge its existence. It’s not about saying all white people are racist and need to change, it’s about showing all people that systemic racism is a very real problem that needs to be addressed. It’s about explaining why the poverty rate in 2018 among Black people is 20.8% versus 8.1% for white people (Bureau, U. S. C.). It’s about explaining why 1 in 3 black men in America are likely to be imprisoned at some point in their life, compared to 1 in 17 white men (“Mass Incarceration”). It’s about explaining why the average graduation rate for white people in the US is 89% yet just 80% for Black people (Coe).\nAdditionally, conservatives have pushed critical race theory as an anti-American, anti-democratic, and often “Communist” theory. They believe that students learning about the United States’ often negative history will turn them, I guess, into revolutionaries who want to overthrow the government. Their prime example of critical race theory’s anti-patriotic ways are the allegations of racism against America’s founding fathers.\nMost proponents of critical race theory wouldn’t argue the genius of someone like Thomas Jefferson. His view of the nation created the foundation of one of the world’s greatest superpowers. However, how can one read the second paragraph of the Declaration of Independence and not see the irony? The country’s founding document explains that “all men are created equal”, yet many of those who signed their name owned other human beings at this time. The nation is founded on hypocrisy. Many of the founding fathers were not great men. Some, it could be argued, were bad. Acknowledging this isn’t anti-America, it isn’t attacking the ideals this country was founded on, it is simply being okay with the country not being perfect and working to fix it.\nWhat is American about forcing ideals on people? The country was founded on a violent revolution to free itself from a “tyrannical” regime. How is wanting to better the nation unamerican? How is pushing ideals that may differ from the norm unamerican? This is supposed to be the land of the free. Freedom of speech includes freedom of thought, and that freedom should be protected. It is not tyrannical to teach our history. However, it is tyrannical to change our history.\nFor years, American education has been white washed. Generations of people have learned an education based on a white person’s perspective, barely touching on slavery outside of an economic factor and instead only focusing on the rare times in history where the country has created a positive for Black people. The Emancipation Proclamation, 13th-15th amendments, Brown vs. Board of Ed., and the Civil Rights Movement are taught as the entirety of Black American history. Black history is American history. They shouldn’t be separated. That’s all critical race theory looks to do. It simply looks to finally teach American history as it should be taught–focusing on ALL Americans, not just those in power.\nDespite all of its positives, critical race theory is being fought by the right as if it’s a bigger threat to Americans than the disease that has killed 800,000. Bills are being passed throughout the nation that would rip funding from schools that teach critical race theory. One bill proposed in Wisconsin would prohibit teaching concepts like “equity”, “institutional oppression”, and “social justice”. In Texas, a new bill just went into law that bans teachers from discussing “a widely debated and currently controversial issue of public policy or social affairs.\" (Garcia). The bill doesn’t specify what is a controversial issue, but a related bill passed made the rounds after a Texas school district executive said”…make sure that if you have a book on the Holocaust, that you have one that has an opposing, that has other perspectives.”. If something as evil, ruthless, and fact-laden as the Holocaust can be deemed “controversial”, then there’s no telling how far this governmental overreach of our education system will go.\nRepublicans’ ability to push everything they don’t like as anti-American, Marxist, and revolutionary is an attempt to maintain power akin to Thomas Jefferson’s original view of public education. Except instead of ensuring only wealthy white men get an education like Jefferson tried, Republicans are trying to make sure that everyone gets an education written by wealthy white men. This allows them to continue to push an idea of American exceptionalism, and call anyone who dares criticize their perfect country unamerican.\nCritical race theory should not be a controversial curriculum. It’s simply creating an education that looks at American history unapologetically and unbiased. America has a dark history, but, as Churchill said, “those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.”. The only true way to better our country is to acknowledge that we have problems. We aren’t a perfect country and trying to ban teachings like critical race theory only threatens to move us backwards.\nWorks Cited\n\nBureau, US Census. “Income, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2018.” Census.gov, 8 Oct. 2021, https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2019/income-poverty.html#:~:text=The%20poverty%20rate%20for%20non,not%20statistically%20different%20from%202017.\nCoe - Public High School Graduation Rates, https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/coi.\nGarcia, Ariana. “A New 'Critical Race Theory' Law Just Went into Effect in Texas Schools.” Chron, Chron, 6 Dec. 2021, https://www.chron.com/politics/article/Texas-critical-race-theory-law-schools-16678700.php.\nGriffin, Nick. “Critical Race Theory. the Actual #Racism Afflicting the Death Pangs of Liberalism.

    "title": "Dying for Capitalism: An Analysis of Marxism",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Dying for Capitalism: An Analysis of Marxism\nWritten for GOVT-114W: International Relations with Prof. Alan Cafruny on 2/15/2023\nABSTRACT: Marxism is one of the most important breakthroughs in international policy, turning the mirror back on the state themselves. This paper investigates the philosophical and historical beginnings of the theory, then uses events as evidence of the theory. It also breaks down the strengths and weaknesses of Marxism, applying these with direct examples.\nToday, Marxism represents much more than an economic theory. Right wing politicians have made it their mission to incorrectly label their dislikes as Marxist. Whether it be social security, the teaching of American racism, or the new M&M mascots. But before it was a buzzword, Marxism was a strong international relations theory used to critically analyze foreign policy decisions. The basic premise of Marxism is that states make policy decisions based on expansionary, capitalist ideals. Examples of state action under these pretenses exist throughout capitalist history, including the American interventions in Iraq, Iran, and Ukraine, as well as the current US-China rivalry.\nThe philosophical origins of Marxism are tied to its original economic basis. As capitalism spread across the world after the British industrial revolution, a rival economic theory came into play. Economic Marxism is predicated on the idea of a revolution resulting in workers taking over and controlling the means of production. Marxism says that the fundamentals of capitalism will inevitably lead to massive class inequality and, eventually, a communist revolution. While Marx himself was much more focused on the actions within states than interstate relations, he did apply his theory to world connections at points.\nMarxism as an international relations theory argues that interstate rivalry is rooted in the expansionary ideals of capitalism. It refutes the weather-vane theory that states actions are pushed by interest groups, with the state itself being a neutral actor. Instead, Marxism argues that the state is structurally controlled by the capitalist ruling elites, so therefore the state itself is an actor. The “best interests” of the state will always be the best interest of the elite and it will make its decisions on this basis. The only way to end this rule is via a revolution that systematically changes the state into a socialist society. Marxism argues that the actions of states are not simply an end, but a means to capitalist expansion.\nThe international relations theory that most staunchly diverges from marxism is liberalism. Liberalism is based on a global free market, arguing that once economic integration occurs across the world, an international community can be created and conflict will be avoided due to economic reliance. The modern day situation in China is a prime example of the differences in theory. While trade between the nations is robust, the United States recently clamped down on the exportation of semiconductors to Chinese customers to prevent the spread of the technology. Many consider this an act of economic warfare and tensions between the nations have continued to grow. Liberals would argue war is being avoided because capitalism is keeping the peace. They would look at the shared reliance on trade and say that the United States and China will never go to war, because it would risk their economic prosperity. Marxists would argue the opposite. They would look at the world’s two largest economies and note that their current rivalry is rooted in capitalism. Modern capitalists need global trade, which inherently leads to global economic rivalry. Capitalism doesn’t have a ceiling. Capitalists have a constant goal: accumulate, accumulate, and accumulate more. In that vein, Marxists would look at the United States-China situation and argue that war is inevitable.\nOne of the most formative events in the spread of Marxism as international relations theory was the United States’ intervention in Iran in the 1950s. Between 1901 and 1952, British owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company enjoyed a monopoly on Iranian oil. In 1951, Mohammed Mossadegh came into power in Iran, expelling the AIOC and nationalizing Iranian oil. In response, the British attempted and failed a coup, leading to the nation inquiring with newly elected US President Dwight Eisenhower about possible US involvement. Eisenhower’s secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, “had two lifelong obsessions: fighting Communism and protecting the rights of multinational corporations”. Knowing this, the British misled Dulles that Mossadegh was pushing Iran toward Communism. The US, pusheed by American oil companies, staged a coup. After a few attempts, the US eventually overtook Mossadegh, bringing in authoritarian General Fazlollah Zahedi (Kinzer). The actions of America in Iran can be used to support a Marxist view of foreign policy, as the government acted in opposition to democratic ideals to overthrow a free government and raise their own stature as an oil king.\nThe strength of Marxism lies in the historical decisions made by nations. The most infamous foreign policy disagreement in the 21st century is the Iraq War. Different theorists have different theories as to why the war was fought. Liberals believe it was to restore United Nation authority and promote human rights in the region. Realists often follow the official American arguments that Saddam Hussein was a threat to world stability and held weapons of mass destruction. Marxists however, promote one of the more controversial arguments: the war was fought to gain oil access in the region and to promote the global capitalist order (Cafruny).\nAt the time of the war, the US had been looking for a chance to consolidate their power in the region. A little over a decade prior, an indebted Hussein had invaded Kuwait to drill for oil, sparking the Gulf War. While the US invasion of Iraq was declared legal under the facade of saving the people of Kuwait, it is not a reach to suggest that the US only entered the war to solidify their control over the Kuwaiti oil supply. After the war ended, Hussein began making oil deals with Russia, Germany, France, China, and other nations. American oil companies, nervous about losing their customers, pushed the Bush administration to come up with a solution. They did, and the United States invaded Iraq after, according to the Center for Public Integrity, “an orchestrated campaign that…led nation to war under decidedly false pretenses” (NPR). As argued by Cafruny, “The Iraq war was fought to reverse the decline of American international oil companies (IOCs) relative to state-owned national oil companies (NOCs) in the Middle East and their less disciplined clients in Europe and Asia, while improving the position of the American IOCs in the struggle for wealth and power.” (Cafruny). American oil companies were desperate for more control in the region, and the invasion of Iraq gave them an excuse.\nIn modern day, the strengths of Marxist theory can be applied to the current Russia-Ukraine war. The United States, while feigning morality, continues to push for the war as a means of weakening Russia. America is fighting a war with Ukranian bodies, and Marxists would argue that a significant factor in the current war was the Russia-Germany gas pipeline. The US has been attempting to end this pipeline so they could begin selling natural gas to Germany for years, and construction on a new one, Nord Stream 2, had begun. At the war’s beginning, the US pressured Germany to punish Russia’s illegal invasion by cutting off the pipeline. Germany abided, but the pipeline was still “mysteriously” destroyed at the beginning of the war. Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh reported evidence that the US had involvement in the pipeline’s destruction, something that was heavily speculated but not confirmed. The demolition of the two Nord Streams allowed for Germany to worry less about increasing their own tensions with Russia, and has led to more German reliance on American gas companies.\nIn general, for strengths and evidence of Marxism, look no further than the Cold War. Every foreign policy decision made by America during the period was made with the intention of spreading the global capitalist order. The Vietnam and Korean wars, their backing of Osama bin Laden in the Afghan War, and the countless coup d'etats they orchestrated all looked to push capitalism. While disguised under “spreading democracy”, the replacing of democratically elected leaders in Chilé and Iran with authoritarians shows that the US would prefer a fascist, capitalist world order than a free, leftist one.\nOn the other hand, Marxism can have some weaknesses. A key error in its development is the assumption of rational actors in power. Since Marxists believe that the state is not a neutral actor and instead structurally created to support the elite, then the decisions of the state should have this same intention. However, some leaders are not rational. Even if there is a “correct” decision to gain that nation economic power, leaders may make different choices based on irrational, moral, or greater political reasons. For example, the US recently affirmed the election of new leftist Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who defeated right wing leader Jair Bolsonaro. After the election, there was a raiding of the Brazilian capital building a la January 6 in the US. America’s Democratic leaders called the election free and fair, something they rarely do with leftist leaders. The reason they would do this is because at this point it is more politically beneficial for Joe Biden to have a leftist running Brazil than it would be to position himself next to right winger Bolsonaro in today’s political climate.\nMarxism is not an extreme idea. It is not this boogeyman like many in American politics try to paint it as. To critique capitalistic structures does not make one a radical, and to unbiasedly view the policy decisions made by capitalistic nations does not make one a leftist. Marxism is a strong international relations theory, and it is past time the world began accepting it as it once did.\nWorks Cited\nCafruny, Alan, and Ted Lehmann. “IMPERIALIST RIVALRY AND THE INVASION OF IRAQ.”\n“Group: 'Orchestrated Deception' by Bush on Iraq.” NPR, NPR, 23 Jan. 2008, https://www.npr.org/2008/01/23/18319248/group-orchestrated-deception-by-bush-on-iraq\nKinzer, Stephen.

    "title": "The Case for Proportional Representation in America",
    "section": "",
    "text": "By Adam Koplik\n\n\nTurns out, the Washington Post over exaggerated what it takes to kill democracy. Cutting out the lights is unnecessary–all you need is a flawed system and a Twitter account. The battle for the American republic has been a push and pull, and as we stare authoritarianism in the face, feasible solutions become more and more undemocratic. The current fight is centered on issue of redistricting. Gerrymandering is the symptom, but the American political system’s lack of true representation leaks deep within it’s foundation. But we could move towards the dream the founding fathers once had, with one change: proportional representation.\nAmerica’s current setup begs for conflict. Democrats have moved to ban partisan gerrymandering in the past–with the 2021 Freedom to Vote Act (H.R. 1) gaining party-wide support only to be stopped short by a Republican filibuster–and are refusing to unilaterally disarm when it comes to redistricting.\nAdditionally, the idea that banning gerrymandering and having lines drawn by a third party would fix the issues is unfortunately not the reality. Take Massachusetts: the bluest of blue states with a 9–0 Democratic advantage in Congress. Democrats no doubt dominate the state, but in the 2024 House elections, Republicans still got 10% of the vote and Independents got 8%. With nine seats, that should be enough for a non-Democratic representative, but in practice, nine Democrats are sent to Washington. Could it be gerrymandering? No, because it is impossible to draw a safe Republican district in the entire state of Massachusetts. There is no feasible scenario where Massachusetts Republicans get any federal government representation under this system. Drawing imaginary lines to decide who has political power is an extremely flawed approach that leaves far too much room for anti-democratic measures to be put into place. So, instead of fighting over the painting, we need to take away the brush.\nProportional representation (PR) is used in nearly 100 nations throughout the world, including Switzerland, Sweden, New Zealand, and Germany. There are a few different methods used in PR governments, including single-transferable vote and mixed member PR, but the most common is party-list PR. Party-list PR is quite simple: vote for a party, seats are allocated proportionally based on that party’s votes. For example, imagine a body has 100 seats and five parties running (A, B, C, D, and E). An election is held, and party A receives 39% of votes, party B receives 20%, C receives 11%, D receives 18%, and E receives 12%. Then, the parties would get 39, 20, 11, 18, and 12 seats in the body, respectively. This system allows for true representation in-lieu of America’s winner-take-all system where, in this scenario, 61% of voters would not have a representative in government. It also creates opportunities for non-major parties to grow, disposing of the concept of “wasted-votes”. So, how could we implement this in America?\n\n\n\nThe House of Representatives is supposed to be the most accurately representative body in the federal government. Seats are proportionally assigned to each state based on population, allowing larger states more power and, in turn, giving each individual person equal say. One vote, one voice. That’s the message that’s supposed to be relayed in the House. Unfortunately, that’s not a reality. Years of gerrymandering, both racial and partisan, have resulted in districts drawn by those in power to remain in power. Districts are drawn with no care to their inhabitants, looking to disenfranchise some and empower others. On top of that, since whoever gets the most votes wins, anybody who doesn’t elect the victorious candidate goes without representation in the House.\nFor my implementation, I kept the 435 House seats as they’ve been assigned, but changed the election to party-list PR. I used the voting data from the 2024 election, and combined all Congressional House elections in each state based on party. Then, I allocated each of the state’s seats based on which party had the most “unrepresented” voters at that time.\nAs an example, let’s take a look at Illinois. In the 2024 election, Republicans managed 46.99% of votes across the House elections, but won just three of the state’s 17 Congressional districts. Based on the total voter turnout across the state of 5,357,262, that means that each representative represents about 315,133 voters. Under the current system, that means that over 1.5 million Illinois Republicans are not being represented in the House. Under a proportional representation system, the seats would be allocated much more akin to the voter’s will. In Illinois, the first seat would go to the Democrats, leaving them with slightly less unrepresented voters than Republicans, so the second seat would go to Rs, and it would alternate itself to a 9–8 Democratic majority–or 52.94% of the seats, as close to the party’s statewide support as there gets.\nAfter doing this for all 50 states, the new House of Representatives ends up pretty similar to the current party totals, but with massive differences in the allocation by state. The Republican majority is maintained, gaining one seat in total, as well as one seat going to both Independents (MA) and Libertarians (TX). On a state level, the biggest changes show that the undemocratic system doesn’t discriminate by party. California, where Republicans would gain 11 seats, sees the most voters gaining representation with an improvement of three million, while in Florida, where Democrats would get four more seats than currently, sees over 1.3 million voters no longer going unrepresented. This system is objective, voter focused, and actually allows for true Congressional representation free from make believe political lines being drawn.\n\n\n\nProposed House of Representatives under a Proportional Representation system\n\n\n\n\n\nBiggest State Changes in Proposed House of Representatives under a Proportional Representation system\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile gerrymandering and drawing districts gets all the glory, the Senate is the most undemocratic body in the American government. 100 seats, evenly distributed across each state with no care for population–only state boundaries. Wyoming, with 1/67 (just under 1.5%) of the population of California, has equal representation as its much larger compatriot with two senators (double the amount of congresspeople given to the state). This is not a loophole, but the system’s inherent design. James Madison, in the Madison papers, wrote, “…as different interests necessarily result from the liberty meant to be secured, the major interest might under sudden impulses be tempted to commit injustice on the minority.”\nThe Senate is a body meant to protect from the tyranny of the majority and the fickleness of a universal democracy. This was to demonstrate itself in two ways: equal representation for each state and indirect election of senators. Until the ratification of the 17th amendment, senators were not elected by voters but by members of the state legislature–meant to be the representatives of the people. Since the Senate uses winner-take-all voting like the majority of the nation, senators are not truly a representation of the state, but of who has been propped up by the major parties in a particular year. Extrapolating votes from the 2024 House elections found that over 50 million voters are without Senate representation at this time. Since senators are elected in two separate elections, plurality parties are often represented twice before the runner-up voters get any.\nTyranny of the majority must be protected, but tyranny of the minority is equally dangerous. States rights are a fundamental trait of the United States, but they can not come at the cost of individual rights. The senators are representatives of the states and, by nature, its people, but now they seem to act as spokespeople for their federal party as a whole. They no longer answer to the people which, as put by Thomas Jefferson, is how democracy dies, “The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny. When the government fears the people,.. there is liberty.”\nMy proposal for the Senate under proportional representation is a similar process to the House, but with a change in the allocation of seats. To protect from both majority and minority overreach, I tried various seat allocations to minimize both state over state power differences (number of senators) and individual over individual power differences (number of people represented by each senator). As an example, currently the state power ratio is 1, since the largest state (CA) and smallest state (WY) have the same number of senators. On the other hand, the individual power ratio is a little over 67, since each senator from California represents 67x more people than each senator from Wyoming. I optimized the following formula (individual power ratio is on the left, state power ratio is on the right):\n\n\n\nOptimiziation Function\n\n\nAs you can see, an optimal solution would be one where the individual power ratio is exactly the value of the representative power ratio squared. For example, if California had 8 million people and Wyoming had 1 million people, allocating California two senators and Wyoming one would result in a representative power ratio of 2:1 and an individual power ratio of 4:1, which would bring an error of zero (work below). In that scenario, California would have 2x the power of Wyoming in the Senate, while an individual voter in Wyoming would have 4x the power of one in California.\n\n\n\nWork Shown\n\n\nUsing this formula and the actual populations, I found allocating four seats to California and one to Wyoming minimizes this error. As a result, California has 4x the senators of Wyoming, but each of Wyoming’s under 588,000 residents have a bit more than 16x the voting power of California’s population. From here, I used a logarithmic scale to allocate seats to the remainder of the states, resulting in the following:\n\n\n\nSeat allocation of the Revised Senate\n\n\nAfterwards, the senators were divied up by party in the same way as the House, based on number of unrepresented voters.\n\n\n\nA potential Senate under a Proportional Representation system\n\n\n\n\n\nA potential Senate under a Proportional Representation system (Map)\n\n\nThe new system results in a staggering over 50 million drop in the number of unrepresented voters in the Senate. Since each senator represents so many more people than each House member, smaller parties were significantly more represented in this revised version of the Senate (now with 120 seats), with Independents (8), Libertarians (5) having big successes. The left-leaning Green (2), Working Class (2), Alliance (1), and Working Families (1) parties all earned seats as well as the Conservative (1), Constitution (1), and Constitutional Conservative parties on the right.\n\n\n\nThe United States is at a turning point in its history. The nation is polarized at a level not seen since the Civil War, and everyday these tensions boil more and more. But this infighting is not a foregone conclusion. Our government has been created and nurtured to promote two major parties that each have the goal of complete destruction of the other. They don’t feel the need to fight for votes because the concept of “wasting your vote” on a third party with no chance of winning feels akin to voting for the party you hate. In turn, there’s no such thing as an anti-establishment vote. Whoever you vote for has millions upon millions of dollars worth of backing and the power to stomp out any alternative parties before they even have a chance. Where has this led us? Tinkering on the cusp of authoritarianism with politicians who don’t truly represent the people making decisions to push us in one direction or the other.\nThis isn’t a partisan issue–based on the 2024 election, Republicans are actually more unrepresented in Congress than Democrats. It doesn’t matter which party is suffering the punishments of our flawed system, it simply matters that there are voters for who our “representative” democracy is not living up to its name. American democracy quiets the voices of both the few and the many, only amplifying the powerful. The founder’s Great Experiment is teetering, but it’s not dead yet. America can continue the mission it was built upon, but it will take drastic changes. Proportional representation is the path to a better, truer democracy.\n\n\n\n\nR, RStudio\n\nTableau\n\nLaTeX (for academic writeup)\n\n\nData from Michael Minn (sourced from state secretary of state electoral results websites) and US Census."

    "text": "Turns out, the Washington Post over exaggerated what it takes to kill democracy. Cutting out the lights is unnecessary–all you need is a flawed system and a Twitter account. The battle for the American republic has been a push and pull, and as we stare authoritarianism in the face, feasible solutions become more and more undemocratic. The current fight is centered on issue of redistricting. Gerrymandering is the symptom, but the American political system’s lack of true representation leaks deep within it’s foundation. But we could move towards the dream the founding fathers once had, with one change: proportional representation.\nAmerica’s current setup begs for conflict. Democrats have moved to ban partisan gerrymandering in the past–with the 2021 Freedom to Vote Act (H.R. 1) gaining party-wide support only to be stopped short by a Republican filibuster–and are refusing to unilaterally disarm when it comes to redistricting.\nAdditionally, the idea that banning gerrymandering and having lines drawn by a third party would fix the issues is unfortunately not the reality. Take Massachusetts: the bluest of blue states with a 9–0 Democratic advantage in Congress. Democrats no doubt dominate the state, but in the 2024 House elections, Republicans still got 10% of the vote and Independents got 8%. With nine seats, that should be enough for a non-Democratic representative, but in practice, nine Democrats are sent to Washington. Could it be gerrymandering? No, because it is impossible to draw a safe Republican district in the entire state of Massachusetts. There is no feasible scenario where Massachusetts Republicans get any federal government representation under this system. Drawing imaginary lines to decide who has political power is an extremely flawed approach that leaves far too much room for anti-democratic measures to be put into place. So, instead of fighting over the painting, we need to take away the brush.\nProportional representation (PR) is used in nearly 100 nations throughout the world, including Switzerland, Sweden, New Zealand, and Germany. There are a few different methods used in PR governments, including single-transferable vote and mixed member PR, but the most common is party-list PR. Party-list PR is quite simple: vote for a party, seats are allocated proportionally based on that party’s votes. For example, imagine a body has 100 seats and five parties running (A, B, C, D, and E). An election is held, and party A receives 39% of votes, party B receives 20%, C receives 11%, D receives 18%, and E receives 12%. Then, the parties would get 39, 20, 11, 18, and 12 seats in the body, respectively. This system allows for true representation in-lieu of America’s winner-take-all system where, in this scenario, 61% of voters would not have a representative in government. It also creates opportunities for non-major parties to grow, disposing of the concept of “wasted-votes”. So, how could we implement this in America?"

    "text": "The House of Representatives is supposed to be the most accurately representative body in the federal government. Seats are proportionally assigned to each state based on population, allowing larger states more power and, in turn, giving each individual person equal say. One vote, one voice. That’s the message that’s supposed to be relayed in the House. Unfortunately, that’s not a reality. Years of gerrymandering, both racial and partisan, have resulted in districts drawn by those in power to remain in power. Districts are drawn with no care to their inhabitants, looking to disenfranchise some and empower others. On top of that, since whoever gets the most votes wins, anybody who doesn’t elect the victorious candidate goes without representation in the House.\nFor my implementation, I kept the 435 House seats as they’ve been assigned, but changed the election to party-list PR. I used the voting data from the 2024 election, and combined all Congressional House elections in each state based on party. Then, I allocated each of the state’s seats based on which party had the most “unrepresented” voters at that time.\nAs an example, let’s take a look at Illinois. In the 2024 election, Republicans managed 46.99% of votes across the House elections, but won just three of the state’s 17 Congressional districts. Based on the total voter turnout across the state of 5,357,262, that means that each representative represents about 315,133 voters. Under the current system, that means that over 1.5 million Illinois Republicans are not being represented in the House. Under a proportional representation system, the seats would be allocated much more akin to the voter’s will. In Illinois, the first seat would go to the Democrats, leaving them with slightly less unrepresented voters than Republicans, so the second seat would go to Rs, and it would alternate itself to a 9–8 Democratic majority–or 52.94% of the seats, as close to the party’s statewide support as there gets.\nAfter doing this for all 50 states, the new House of Representatives ends up pretty similar to the current party totals, but with massive differences in the allocation by state. The Republican majority is maintained, gaining one seat in total, as well as one seat going to both Independents (MA) and Libertarians (TX). On a state level, the biggest changes show that the undemocratic system doesn’t discriminate by party. California, where Republicans would gain 11 seats, sees the most voters gaining representation with an improvement of three million, while in Florida, where Democrats would get four more seats than currently, sees over 1.3 million voters no longer going unrepresented. This system is objective, voter focused, and actually allows for true Congressional representation free from make believe political lines being drawn.\n\n\n\nProposed House of Representatives under a Proportional Representation system\n\n\n\n\n\nBiggest State Changes in Proposed House of Representatives under a Proportional Representation system"

    "text": "While gerrymandering and drawing districts gets all the glory, the Senate is the most undemocratic body in the American government. 100 seats, evenly distributed across each state with no care for population–only state boundaries. Wyoming, with 1/67 (just under 1.5%) of the population of California, has equal representation as its much larger compatriot with two senators (double the amount of congresspeople given to the state). This is not a loophole, but the system’s inherent design. James Madison, in the Madison papers, wrote, “…as different interests necessarily result from the liberty meant to be secured, the major interest might under sudden impulses be tempted to commit injustice on the minority.”\nThe Senate is a body meant to protect from the tyranny of the majority and the fickleness of a universal democracy. This was to demonstrate itself in two ways: equal representation for each state and indirect election of senators. Until the ratification of the 17th amendment, senators were not elected by voters but by members of the state legislature–meant to be the representatives of the people. Since the Senate uses winner-take-all voting like the majority of the nation, senators are not truly a representation of the state, but of who has been propped up by the major parties in a particular year. Extrapolating votes from the 2024 House elections found that over 50 million voters are without Senate representation at this time. Since senators are elected in two separate elections, plurality parties are often represented twice before the runner-up voters get any.\nTyranny of the majority must be protected, but tyranny of the minority is equally dangerous. States rights are a fundamental trait of the United States, but they can not come at the cost of individual rights. The senators are representatives of the states and, by nature, its people, but now they seem to act as spokespeople for their federal party as a whole. They no longer answer to the people which, as put by Thomas Jefferson, is how democracy dies, “The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Second Cold War: An Analysis of US-China Relations**\nWritten for GOVT-114W: International Relations with Prof. Alan Cafruny on 5/11/2023\nABSTRACT: The US and China are on the brink of a Second Cold War. With China’s economic and global political power growing by the day, decades long American unipolarity is under threat. In this essay, I will show that, while there are strategies the US could pursue to contain China, they are not as beneficial as an allyship with the nation would be.\nOn November 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall fell. This marked the end of the decades long Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union and the beginning of American unilateral dominance. For the ensuing decades, the US maintained a stranglehold over the rest of the world, with no worthy competitor appearing. It wasn’t until the Obama administration’s “Pivot to Asia” that the threat of China on American hegemony was really taken seriously. Now, the question is presented: can the US hope to contain China? While there are strategies that could be implemented to achieve this containment, the economic and global stability risks associated with them are not worth it.\nRichard Nixon’s visit to China marked an unprecedented turning point in US-China relations. It created the beginning of a partnership between two of the world’s largest nations–one that reaped benefits for both sides. The US viewed China as a location for use cheap labor and lesser regulations to bolster US companies and increase US technology. On the other hand, China viewed the US as a nation that it could use to increase its global power–which is exactly what it did, using its role as a manufacturing haven to bolster its economy and become one of the worlds largest markets. This marked the beginning of a strong interdependence between the two nations, with China becoming “America’s biggest supplier of imported goods and its top source of international students, while the United States is now China’s number one export destination and its most important foreign financial partner” (Bateman). This relationship was without issue for a long time, but now, the US sees China’s power as growing too much to the point of threat.\nThe official American shift as it relates to China came during the Obama administration’s “pivot to Asia”. The administration increased military and economic relations with Vietnam, South Korea, and Japan, among others, looking to prevent Chinese unilateral power on the continent. This came as China was prepping to overtake the US as the world’s largest economy which happened in in 2014, when “the International Monetary Fund announced that, when measured in terms of purchasing power parity, China had passed the United States…Measured by market exchange rate, China’s GDP is now nearly 70 percent of the United States’” (Layne). This key shift represented the beginning of what would soon become an all out economic war between the two nations, and the beginning of a Second Cold War.\nDonald Trump ran for President on the basis of ultranationalism that found itself often pointing in China’s direction. With the loss of the American middle class and manufacturing jobs, many of which fleeing to China, Trump tugged at the anger of Americans who felt left behind and wanted an enemy. He made China that enemy, and, when elected, put in place massive economic restrictions against China. The most important of these was probably the strict tariffs put in place by the administration in its early days. China retaliated with tariffs of their own targeting US farmers and manufacturing workers. Additionally “Export controls targeting China were greatly intensified, most notably via the Department of Commerce’s Entity List that restricts foreign companies from importing U.S. products. The number of unique Chinese firms on this list quadrupled from 2018-2022” (Layne). These policies led to “the Chinese foreign ministry proclaim[ing] that the United States had started ‘the largest trade war’ in history” (Cafruny).\nUnder the Biden administration, it has been more of the same. The anti-China rhetoric and policies that were prevalent under Trump continued in an increasingly bipartisan manner. While Biden moved away from some of the more xenophobic and strawman arguments made under Trump, like the talk of banning TikTok just for Chinese association, he replaced it with stronger policy. His administration has continued fighting the economic war, filling in “some important gaps — requiring proof, for example, that imports from Xinjiang weren’t made with forced labor” (Bateman).\nAt the heart of the Chinese-American economic war sits semiconductors. Semiconductors are the main ingredient in a ton of revolutionary technology including electric cars and will be the most important resource in the world over the coming decades. Currently, neither of the two nations are overwhelmingly producing their own semiconductors. China sits ahead of the US who have responded by creating massive sanctions on China to try to avoid the expansions of Chinese semiconductor manufacturing. The US has begun trying to involve Japan and South Korea in the semiconductor supply chain, as well as the all important Taiwan.\nSo, who is winning this second Cold War at this point? China is certainly not in their best state, with “China…experiencing a host of serious problems including massive surplus capacity, mounting debt now at 260% of (officially declared) GdP and problems in the”belt and Road” project designed in part to export surplus capacity…China’s growth rate has steadily declined” (Cafruny). Still, while China is not thriving, the US-Chinese interdependence is still high. “Interdependence is everywhere you look, from semiconductors (the U.S. chip industry gets one third of its revenue from China) to manufacturing (China is a critical hub for companies like Apple and Tesla) to science (Chinese and American scientists author more joint papers than any other country pair)” (Bateman).\nTo this point, no one is winning the economic war. However, that doesn’t mean one of the two won’t eventually move ahead. Which presents the question: is any of this worth it? Is American hegemony really worth destroying the relationship between the US and possibly their strongest economic partner? More importantly, is it worth potentially putting lives on the line to further America’s stance in the world?\nIn Layne’s “Coming Storms”, he draws intense parallels between the current US-China situation and that between Germany and Britain during the 1910s. Both situations saw fast growing nations come to a head with the current unilateral world power. Then, it resulted in the partial destruction of the European continent. Now, it would likely see violence fought over Taiwan. Taiwan, the source of 90% of semiconductor manufacturing, represents a tense argument between the two nations. While in the past the US has respected the “One China” policy and refused to recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation, more recently the US has pulled back on these methods. US leaders like Nancy Pelosi have visited the nation, and Taiwanese leaders have visited America. China has responded with shows of force like bomb tests. It seems as though the US is trying to bait the Chinese into a war, and more than likely, Taiwan will be the place of fighting. The Taiwanese don’t believe the semiconductor question can be decided via violence however, with the chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company saying, “Nobody can control TSMC by force. If you take a military force or invasion, you will render TSMC factory non-operable, because this is such a sophisticated manufacturing facility [that] it depends on the real-time connection with the outside world — with Europe, with Japan, with the US.”\nThe US and China currently find themselves embroiled in what many consider to be the second Cold War. While we managed to survive the first one without global catastrophe, there were several close calls. In the movie \"13 Days,\" a character states that \"If the sun comes up tomorrow, it is only because of men of good will. That is all there is between us and the devil.\" This illustrates just how close we were to annihilation and how much we relied on the kindness of others to prevent it. Unfortunately, it seems we are on a path that could lead us back to that brink. Hypothetically, the US has the power to engage in both physical and economic warfare to contain China, but it would come at an immeasurable cost. The better path forward is one of bilateral support between the two most powerful nations in the world. It's possible for the US and China to exist in competitive harmony without resorting to violence or death. While this will require individuals of good will to come together, it is the most viable option for a peaceful and prosperous future.\nWorks Cited\nBateman, Jon. “Opinion: The Fevered Anti-China Attitude in Washington Is Going to Backfire.” POLITICO, www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/12/15/china-tech-decoupling-sanctions-00071723.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Mental Health Matters\nWritten for SOC-205: Sociology of Mental Health & Illness with Prof. Matthew Grace on 5/5/2024\nLast winter, I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder and started medicine to treat it. My willingness to admit this doesn’t come from a place of searching for pity or trying to show my relation to the topic, but from a lack of shame surrounding it. These identities are a part of my personality, and a part of what makes me the person I am. It is a characteristic of myself just like my height, weight, or hair color. However, when I apply to jobs, I don’t disclose it. I don’t tell employers and rarely tell professors about it. I don’t consider it a negative part of myself, but I know that when I admit to it, it will become something tattooed onto the outside perception of myself.\nMental Health Matters. That’s one of the many bumper sticker slogans that has been plastered across the United States over the past few years. There has been a coordinated effort to alleviate the stigma and attempt to make it “okay to not be okay!”. From Ted Lasso giving a speech at the White House about mental health to the normalization of mental health days in classrooms, it has seemed like society has made progress in allowing people to be open about what’s ailing them. Emphasis on seemed like.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in reported mental health issues among adolescents. According to the National Institute for Mental Health, “adolescents assessed after the pandemic shutdowns reported more symptoms of anxiety and depression and greater internalizing problems.” This study didn’t just focus on adolescents during the midst of the pandemic, but the long term effects of it via brain imaging. They found a thinning of the cortex and smaller hippocampus and amygdala. Brain portions that play roles in things like self-control, memories, and regulating emotions. The post-pandemic brain was more similar to that of an elderly person or one who was under chronic childhood stress. The pandemic actively changed the brain chemistry of the young people who went through it.\nAnother group that was slammed by COVID-19 were healthcare workers. Few could forget the viral videos of New York City residents cheering their support for doctors and nurses or the signs of support plastered throughout communities. They were on the front lines, experiencing the suffering and death of patients on a daily basis. It undoubtedly took an intense toll on them. In general, according to the CDC, health care workers are at a disproportionately high risk of suicide as compared to other professions. A study by the NIMH found a higher prevalence of depression, PTSD related to COVID trauma, and anxiety among physicians with higher COVID-19 exposure. While doctors were labeled heroes at home, the mental health toll they take on is a constant (Adams, et al. 2023).\nIn April 2020, a New York City based physician named Lorna Breen took her own life. She was slammed with long hours, seeing severely ill COVID patients dying daily. Stressed and struggling, she attempted to seek help, but was terrified she would lose her position, and the situation ended in as terrible as one could. An NPR article explored this and the stigma often attached to mental health in healthcare workers. Focusing on a Massachusetts based policy change in which health insurers have sworn to no longer ask about mental health history and only focus on the present, an attempt to reduce the stigma surrounding health care worked mental health is necessary. Over two dozen states have put in similar statements, attempting to alleviate physician’s fears that they could lose their position for disclosing mental health (McCluskey, 2024).\nThis shift is incredibly necessary. A health care worker is in no way more or less qualified just because they’ve gone through struggles in their past or present. Society places a superhero expectation on doctors, and when they expose themselves as humans, it excommunicates them from the field. However, the issue with the policy is that it still perpetrates the negative stigma inherent with mental illness. Saying that a physician’s past mental health isn’t important, only today, still could make a physician hesitant to admit to struggles. It still assumes that a physician cannot perform their duties if they’re experiencing negative mental health, and perpetrates this stigma.\nEven among those who do allow themselves to seek treatment and diagnoses, there is still a significant attempt made to separate themselves from the stigma of “mentally ill”. A study showed that 80% of clients at a community mental health center agreed that “My mental illness is only a small part of who I am” and 78% said “When I see how mental illness is portrayed in the media, I think ’that’s not me” (Macrussen, et al. 2021). There’s an assumption of negativity with mental illness that is hard to seperate.\nSimilar stigmas have been found in other professions, and in general society has seemed to almost destigmatize mental health in the past few years. In 2022, the American Psychiatric Association conducted a poll in which they found that under half of workers (48%) feel they can discuss mental health “openly and honestly with their supervisor”. This is a decrease from the two previous years. While there was a decrease in worry about retaliation for time off, it still represents how much steam “Mental Health Matters” lost in the past couple of years (Employees…).\nMental illness is a describing characteristic of who someone is. The desire to resist this stigma is only apparent because of the inherent negativity surrounding. It’s why, as society seems to move away from promoting mental health, it’s key that we bring it back to the path we were on years ago. This is still a key issue and the stigma is still apparent. Destigmatization has gone a long way, but not far enough. It’s not just saying “be open about your issues!”, it’s about equating mental and physical health. If a doctor breaks their wrist, no one is going to ask them to perform surgery. But, if they in the midst of an anxious or depressive episode, they’re expected to push it to the side and get back to their job. Mental health and physical health are one in the same. There must be an effort to equate them.\nWorks Cited\nAdams, G. C., Le, T., Alaverdashvili, M., & Adams, S. (2023, May).

The monetary amount agreed upon was never disclosed–to this day, “no tribal member outside the three member tribal executive committee knows…” (Kamps, 2001). After decades of legal fights, the project was halted. The case is an incredibly interesting investigation into the role of tribal sovereignty in environmental justice and the economic injustices that inform their decisions.\nAt the time of the agreement, just 25 tribe members actually inhabited the reservation. The other 100 or so Band members lived a bit closer to Salt Lake City. The displacement out of this group was no accident, but a series of environmental destruction that brought about the inhabitant dispossession of their land. Surrounding the reservation is the Magnesium Corporation–the “nations worst air polluter” (Kamps, 2001) that has brought about chlorine gas, acid clouds, and hazardous landfills. In 1968, Dugway Proving Grounds testing of VX nerve gas resulted in the “accidental” death of 6,400 sheep in Skull Valley. On top of this, half of the US Army chemical weapon stockpile is burning in a nearby incinerator and the local Air Force base is dropping bombs, misfiring missiles, and crashing jets all in the surrounding area. This concerted effort from both the government and corporations has resulted in an inhospitable economy for the tribe. Leon Bear, the chairman who signed the dump deal in 1996, said “We can't do anything here that's green or environmental. Would you buy a tomato from us if you knew what's out here? Of course not”.\nClear parallels exist between the story of the Skull Valley Band and that of the characters in Ann Pancake’s Strange As This Weather Has Been. Similarly, the Appalachian characters have seen their home’s health systematically attacked by corporations looking to exploit the land for profit. The coal mining industry and the nuclear industry–seen as rivals by the average American environmentally–are two sides of the same coin when it comes to the exploitation of people. As a result of the environmental destruction of these areas came their economic demolition. Both the Skull Valley Band and the Appalachian people in Strange As… suffer from massive unemployment and high poverty rates, making them easy targets for the large companies to dispossess them from their lands. These companies create the illness (poverty) so they can sell the disease (money for land).\nThe reason the Skull Valley case is so interesting is that it’s not simply a case of the United States government violating a treaty. It is, however, a clear case of environmental injustice. Yes, the contract was signed by the Band’s tribal chairman. However, it was clear and obvious why the Goshute were targeted–they’re an incredibly small, impoverished tribe that would be easy to manipulate in the eyes of a corporation. Yet, even justice has a price. In 2000, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission deemed that the dump does not violate environmental justice because PFS’s price was so high. Additional agreements were made between PFS and local opposition like cattle ranchers and Tooele County in the years after to get the dump moving forward. Utah Governor Mike Leavitt put it bluntly, saying, “It’s pretty clear that utilities are willing to spend billions to move the spent fuel out of their back yard into ours.”\nThe case is a prime example of the cheapening discussed in Jason Moore and Raj Patel’s “A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things: A Guide to Capitalism, Nature, and the Future of the Planet”. Colonialism’s devaluation of nature and people in the name of productivity is a clear cycle that seems inescapable, valuing “only what it [capitalism] can count, and it can count only dollars” (Moore & Patel, 2021, p. 21). This cheapening begins at the changing of one singular letter: Nature vs. nature. Capitalism has created this naturalization of ecology as a resource to be turned into production. It has formed an imaginary hierarchy where Society is the boss of Nature and can control Nature to its whims. In this, human beings are also brought into the folds of Nature, with Indigenous peoples not being considered members of Society and therefore being disposable and able to be exploited. The actions of PFS are a clear example of this. Not only do they want to use the natural world as a dumping ground for toxins, showing a complete apathy for the non-human life that inhabits the area, but they want to use the tribe members themselves to do their bidding for them. This creation infighting of oppressed people is a classic maneuver used by oppressors to distance themselves from the problems they’re creating.\nTo see this shift of blame one had to look no further than the Skull Valley Band’s own website. A quote from scientist Marie Curie, “Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood”, was plastered along with arguments for why nuclear science is safe and a good economic decision for the tribe. The argument for the lease was being made by tribe members themselves. This inviting of Native nations into exploitative economic partnerships was coined by Randel Hanson as, “new Indian capitalism” (Hanson, 2001, p. 25). Tribal sovereignty and economic independence have been pitched as one and the same. The argument from neoliberal colonialists is clear: if tribes want freedom, they have to be able to afford it. This economic partnership mirrors other exploitative ones, “Housing these forms of garbage on reservations ‘off-shores’ it in a way not dissimilar to…locating factories in underdeveloped nations” (Hanson, 2001, p. 32). The proposals shape themselves as allowing sovereignty, but asks them to participate in the same activities that took it away in the first place. Margene Bullcreek, an avid opposer of the dump, put it bluntly: “Sovereignty isn’t selling your independence and your heritage to the highest bidder” (Kamps, 2001).\nThe consequences of this are explored in Kyle Whyte’s “Indigenous Climate Change Studies: Indigenizing Futures, Decolonizing the Anthropocene”. Members of the Skull Valley Band don’t actually have a say in the use of their land. They’re told to choose between bad and worse, and then have it made out to seem like they agreed to whatever consequences they suffer. Indigenous peoples have become the vicitm’s of a cultural genocide that makes it seem as though the problems they face are their own doing. Whyte discusses this, saying “Indigenous peoples live in worlds so changed by colonialism, capitalism, and industrialization that our collective self-determination and agency are compromised” (Whyte, 2017, p. 160).\nBy coating environmental injustice in the disguise of economic opportunity, corporations are profiting off of the problems they’ve already caused. Tribal chairman Leon Bear, who had agreed to the contract, said “People need to understand that this whole area has already been deemed a waste zone by the federal government, the state of Utah and the county” (Ishayam & TallBear, 2001, p. 5). This erie view of the situation puts into perspective why Bear made the decision he did. The tribe had already been written off entirely, and the area was seen as a waste zone. The only way out, Bear believed, was by embracing the colonial actions that have brought so much destruction in the past. As Whyte discussed, this line of thinking is an example of how Native people have survived an apocalypse, saying “Native Americans have seen the end of their respective worlds” (Whyte, 2017, p. 160). The “New Indian Capitalism” is a direct symptom with the destruction of Native civilization and knowledge.\nSo what can be done? Ishiyama and TallBear critique the narrow view of environmental justice, saying, “This paper challenges the predominant tradition of environmental justice scholarship and activism that focus on the inequitable distribution of hazards in low-income minority communities” (Ishiyama & TallBear, 2001, p. 1). Framing environmental justice activists as only opposing the economic opportunities presented to them undermines the members of the tribes themselves, assuming that, “Indians lack the intelligence to balance and adequately protect their own economic and environmental interests” (Ishiyama & TallBear, 2001, p. 2). They argue that the white environmental justice approach ignores the participants, only focused on the results of the decision and not the process. White activists support tribes conditionally, only accepting those that conform to their own environmentalist beliefs and disparaging those that do not. They position internal struggles as “occurring between morally pure ‘traditionalists’ and less moral ‘assimilationists’ (Ishiyama & TallBear, 2001, p. 2). This then posits the assimilationist leaders as colonial sympathizers who are exploiting their own people, ignoring the environmental racism and oppression that has impacted whatever decision they’re making.\nProcess versus results is an incredibly important distinction to make when discussing environmental justice. A decision that is seen as pro-environment (say, transitioning from coal to water power) can still be environmentally unjust if it is not made through the proper channels. Currently, environmentalism is dominated by highly educated, White activists. Indigenous voices are often muted and, even when considered, viewed as monoliths where all members of the tribe hold the same values.\nThe main theme of these discussions is actually quite simple: tribal sovereignty. The Skull Valley Band has the right to agree–and also to fight against–any decisions that affect them. The key is to accept their sovereignty while still remembering the context that has put them in the situation in the first place. Institutional, structural racism has oppressed many Indigenous peoples, resulting in poverty and a dispossession of their own land. Even when they exercise sovereignty, it still exists in the oppressed context that has put them into making the decision, as “that tribe and tribes in general have never participated in the decision-making process that has lead to the production of nuclear waste or that has lead to the absence of alternate means of economic survival in the desert landscape to which this tribe has been relocated” (Ishiyama & TallBear, 2001, p. 10).\nThese problems are symptoms of the cycle of capitalistic exploitation that creates systems of poverty so people can be exploited. After all, it’s much easier to steal from the hungry than the full. By ignoring the system and viewing each decision on a case-by-case basis, Native tribes are put at fault for choosing one of two evils. As put by Keith Lewis of the Serpent River First Nation, “There is nothing moral about tempting a starving man with money” (Kamps, 2001).\nThe project eventually was halted after years of protest from the state of Utah, environmental groups, and fellow tribe members like Bullcreek. The argument is much larger than should the project have been completed or not though. The villainization of tribe members like Bear from activists ignore the situation that these leaders have been forced to make decisions in. As Indigenous Environmental Network director Tom Goldtooth said, “...The Tribe is not the enemy here, Private Fuel Storage is. The State needs to look at policies that threaten the Tribes health and well-being and work to rectify those first.” (Kamps, 2001).\nTribes are working to help their place and their people. They’ve been pushed into a corner by colonial powers that have systematically stolen their land, their bodies, and their culture. Critiquing leaders for choosing one of two bad situations ignores that they’ve been forced to choose by these powers. Tribal sovereignty and environmental justice work hand in hand. To force any Western views onto them is to take their right of choice. For too long colonial powers have been telling Indigenous people what is the okay decision. It is their land. It has always been their land.\nThe way to fight environmentally dangerous policies like the Skull Creek Band nuclear dump is not to fight the proposal, but to have fought the poverty that made the Band an easy target for PFS. Environmental justice, economic justice, racial justice–they’re all the same thing. Justice is justice. To fight for the world is to fight for nature. To fight for nature is to fight for people. Until society switches away from exploitative measures and towards a more holistic, equitable system, there will always be another nuclear dump. Like a hydra, when one anti-environment measure dies, three more grow in its place. The solution is not to win every small battle, but to just win one: the culture. True environmental justice must respect tribal sovereignty while addressing the economic inequalities that have lingered for generations.\nWorks Cited\nHanson, R. D. (2001).

    "text": "Start from Scratch: Analyzing the Replacement of NAFTA with the USMCA\nWritten for GOVT-114W: International Relations with Prof. Alan Cafruny on 5/11/2023\nABSTRACT: The North American Free Trade Agreement was a groundbreaking agreement between its three members. Now, 30 years later, it has been ripped up and replaced. In this essay, I will analyze the pros and cons of NAFTA and show that the USMCA represents a massive step forward.\nNearly three decades ago, the United States, Canada, and Mexico took a bold step towards economic integration by signing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It was a groundbreaking move that united two of the world's most developed nations with a rapidly developing neighbor, creating a powerful trade bloc. But despite its ambitious goals, NAFTA fell short of expectations and became a hotly debated topic among politicians in all three countries. It's no surprise that the Trump administration sought to negotiate a new deal, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), to replace NAFTA. In hindsight, it's clear that NAFTA had a negative impact on both the US and Mexico. The USMCA is a welcome step forward that will create new opportunities for businesses and workers alike, bringing us one step closer to a truly integrated and prosperous continent.\nIn 1993, the Clinton administration signed the controversial NAFTA agreement, a first of its kind. “NAFTA eliminated most tariffs on products traded between the three countries, with a major focus on liberalizing trade in agriculture, textiles, and automobile manufacturing. The deal also sought to protect intellectual property, establish dispute resolution mechanisms, and, through side agreements, implement labor and environmental safeguards” (Chatzky, et al.). The US and Canada hoped that NAFTA would lead to a stronger Mexican economy, which would in turn become a location for low cost labor. Overall, NAFTA is seen by many economists as a wash. \"NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters. The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest,\" per the Congressional Research Service (Geewak).\nStill, NAFTA was not without its benefits for both US and Mexico. From a purely neoliberal outlook, trade more than tripled between the three nations with Canada and Mexico ranking as the top two nations for US exports. For the US, North America has appeared as a strong market for manufacturing vehicles, “…so when you are buying a vehicle assembled in Canada, it contains lots of made-in-America parts” (Geewak). Additionally, the US has seen a trade surplus of almost $30-billion under NAFTA.\nFor Mexico, there was a massive increase in agricultural imports after NAFTA. While this has its flaws, it made the country less reliant on their own farm based economy which was more variable to weather events and such. Additionally, it has resulted in an overall increase in wealth for the nation. Mexico has developed very fast and has seen growth from its middle class.\nOn the other hand, critics of NAFTA have a ton of ammunition. One of few things agreed by both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders was that NAFTA has led to a loss of US manufacturing jobs. The Economic Policy Institute found that US workers have lost almost 700,000 jobs specifically to Mexican rivals. However this is far from a zero sum game, “while millions of U.S. manufacturing jobs have melted away over the last two decades, economists attribute most of those losses to new technologies and Asian competition, not NAFTA” (Geewak). NAFTA’s almost complete lack of labor rights or protections for American workers was a massive oversight that put the growth of the global capitalist economy over that of actual workers.\nFor Mexico, NAFTA was pretty much a disaster. Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari believed NAFTA was a chance to “modernize the Mexican economy so that it would ‘export goods, not people’”. While it did see growth in its exports and trade, Mexican workers didn’t reap the benefits. “Poverty remains at the same levels as in 1994. And the expected convergence of U.S. and Mexican wages didn’t happen, with Mexico’s per capita income rising at an average of just 1.2 percent annually in that period…” (Chatzky, et al.).\nThe biggest negative impact to come out of NAFTA came with the change of food production. As put by Carlsen, “economic efficiency dictates that each country should devote its productive capacity to what it does best and trade liberalization will guarantee access across borders. trade liberalization.” At the time it was signed, corn was the biggest resource to be developed by Mexican farmers. However, since its yields were significantly below that of the US, Mexican farmers stopped being able to compete with the imported corn and were not backed by their government, instead being told to find jobs in manufacturing, since that was going to be Mexico’s main role in NAFTA. What ensued was a corporate takeover of the Mexican food system, leading to increasing unemployment, lower health standards for their food (Mexico has the second worst morbid obesity rate behind the US), and an exodus of jobless Mexicans to the US to try to find work. While the more industrialized north saw some betterment compared to the agricultural south, “the areas that adapted successfully to industrial agriculture and agroexport crops are characterized by flagrant violation of the labor rights of migrant farm workers, widespread pollution and water waste, and extreme concentration of land and resources” (Carlsen).\nFor both the US and Mexico, the US-Mexico-Canada agreement was a necessary step forward in trade negotiations and the world economy. It addressed issues surrounding labor protections, jobs in the US, and environmental rights. One of its stronger stipulations was the demand that 75% of vehicles assembled in a nation must originate in the member countries. This avoids outsourcing parts to non-member countries and ensures more manufacturing jobs stay. Another key addition made is the stipulation that 40% of each vehicle must come from factories paying at least $16 an hour. This small but strong addition endorses better labor rights and help for workers who were overall left behind by NAFTA. It also requires more Mexican recognition of unions and collective bargaining agreements, measures to combat illegal fishing and wildlife trafficking, and the extension of patent protections for certain drugs. In comparison to NAFTA, USMCA is a massively more worker based agreement that, while not without its faults, is a massive step forward (Chatzky, et al.).\nNAFTA was a disastrous agreement that caused more harm than good. Despite promises of economic growth and job creation, it resulted in a meager increase in GDP while sacrificing thousands of American and Mexican jobs. As if that wasn't bad enough, it also exacerbated inequality in Mexico and created a \"profoundly unhealthy food system for the entire [Mexican] region\" (Carlsen). This agreement was a slap in the face to workers and prioritized expanding the global capitalist order above all else. It was a complete failure that demanded immediate attention. Thankfully, the USMCA is a step in the right direction, placing a greater emphasis on workers' rights than most US trade agreements. However, there's still much work to be done. The massive globalist trade will always leave domestic workers at risk, and member economies must prioritize the well-being of workers over the pockets of the elite. The USMCA must be used as a catalyst for positive change, a starting point for the creation of a fairer, more equal trade system that empowers workers and brings prosperity to all members of society.\nWorks Cited\nCarlsen, Laura. “NAFTA Is Starving Mexico - FPIF.” Foreign Policy In Focus, 9 May 2013, fpif.org/nafta_is_starving_mexico/.\nChatzky, et al., Andrew, et al. “NAFTA and the USMCA: Weighing the Impact of North American Trade.” Council on Foreign Relations, 1 July 2020, www.cfr.org/backgrounder/naftas-economic-impact.\nGeewax, Marilyn. “Economists Toast 20 Years of NAFTA; Critics Sit out the Party.” NPR, 8 Dec. 2013, www.npr.org/2013/12/08/249079453/economists-toast-20-years-of-nafta-critics-sit-out-the-party."

    "section": "",
    "text": "With(out) Reason: Why Russia Invaded Ukraine*\nWritten for GOVT-114W: International Relations with Prof. Alan Cafruny on 4/14/2023\nABSTRACT: This paper examines the root causes of Russia's military intervention in Ukraine, which has been widely condemned as an illegal act of aggression. While many attribute the invasion to Vladimir Putin's authoritarianism, this paper argues that the situation is far more complex. The paper identifies historical grievances, NATO expansion, and domestic political instability in Russia as key factors that led to the conflict. These factors create a complex web of tensions and motivations that complicate efforts to assign blame or find a resolution. Overall, this paper seeks to provide a more nuanced understanding of the conflict and its underlying causes.\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia ended a decades-long European peace with the invasion of Ukraine. Immediately, the Western world condemned Putin and his nation, claiming the invasion was a product of his tyranny. Over the past 14 months, Western opinion on the war hasn’t shifted, getting even more intense. President Joe Biden said in February, that the United States is “in the great battle for freedom: a battle between democracy and autocracy, between liberty and repression, between a rules-based order and one governed by brute force” (“Remarks by President Biden…\"). Around the same time, Putin shifted the war’s blame onto the west, saying”I want to repeat: it is they who are culpable for the war, and we are using force to stop it” (Armstrong). So, who is right? Who is truly to blame for the war? In reality, there is no clear answer, but a mixture of blame to go around.\nThe history of the region between Russia and Ukraine can be traced back to the Soviet era, when the two nations were part of the Soviet Union. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Ukraine gained independence and became a sovereign nation, but tensions with Russia persisted, particularly over the status of Crimea, which has a significant Russian-speaking population. Although Crimea was made part of Ukraine during the Soviet era, Russia annexed the territory after a Ukrainian coup that installed a Western-backed leader. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 was viewed as a violation of Ukraine's territorial sovereignty and sparked ongoing conflict in the region. The strategic importance of Crimea, which houses Russia's main naval base and provides access to the Black Sea, has made the conflict particularly contentious. The tensions escalated over the past decade, leading to a sort of civil war between pro-Russian separatist groups and Ukrainian loyalists, culminating in the recent full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nIn Putin’s “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians”, he breaks down the ethnic and historical similarities between the Russian and Ukrainian people, linking them to the same lineage. He argues that the two nations are one people, noting that the two countries were historically part of the same state with many shared traditions and values. He implies that Western nations like the United States seek to use Ukraine as a geopolitical pawn while also expressing concern for the treatment of ethnic Russians in Ukrainian territories (Putin). While this concern has been scoffed at by the West, recent comments by Ukrainian Senior Advisor Mykhailo Podolyak support Putin’s analysis, saying “We have to eradicate everything Russian. There should be only Ukrainian cultural space or global cultural space. We should not have a dialogue about whether a person has the right to use the Russian language or not” (Lieven). These comments by Podolyak are indicative of the views of far-right nationalists that hold high roles in the Ukrainian government. Many fear that these hard-liners, who hold significant influence and power, could prove to be a formidable obstacle to bringing an end to the war.\nRussia portrays the ongoing war as being fueled in part by historical grievances, while the United States attributes its cause to the tyrannical nature of Vladimir Putin. According to the Western narrative, Putin's grip on power was being threatened by a faltering economy and diminishing global influence. In response, he launched an invasion of Ukraine in the hopes of securing a swift victory and rallying support at home while expanding Russia's territory. Many have drawn parallels between his aims and the expansionist policies of the former Soviet Union. As President Biden has stated, this is a battle between autocracy and democracy, reminiscent of the ideological justifications for proxy wars during the Cold War, such as Vietnam and Korea.\nA key difference between the current situation and the Cold War era is that the rest of the world is not necessarily on board with the Western perspective. In countries such as China, India, and Turkey, between 69-79% of people view Russia as a strategic ally, and a significant portion believe that ending the war should be the highest priority, even if it means significant concessions on the part of Ukraine (Lyshen). By contrast, the US has taken a hard-line stance on the conflict. When viewed in such stark terms, there is little room for nuance or compromise. The Biden administration sees the conflict as a battle between good and evil, with no room for negotiation or compromise with the perceived forces of evil.\nThe final and possibly most important cause of the war is the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or NATO. Since its creation in the 40s, NATO has been America’s most important alliance, but many have warned against its expansion. In 1998, former US director of policy planning George Kennan said about NATO’s expansion, “'I think it is the beginning of a new cold war…I think it is a tragic mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever. No one was threatening anybody else. This expansion would make the Founding Fathers of this country turn over in their graves.” (Friedman). Kennan’s criticisms were echoed by CIA Director William Burns in a leaked embassy cable saying, “NATO enlargement, particularly to Ukraine…could potentially split the country in two, leading to violence or even, some claim, civil war, which would force Russia to decide whether to intervene.” (“Submit Documents…”).\nAs NATO has expanded over the years, Russia has grown increasingly wary of American interference in its sphere of influence. The US-led invasions of Serbia, Iraq, and Libya, all conducted under the backing of NATO, set off alarm bells in the Kremlin. Moreover, the US's withdrawal from the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty and the Iran Nuclear Deal have only fueled Russian distrust of the United States. From the Russian perspective, America is an expansionist power that cannot be negotiated with or trusted. They see the US as being incapable of honoring agreements, with no checks or balances or ability to be policed by the world.\nThe expansion of NATO to the east began to terrify Russia, especially after Ukraine's 2014 coup, which increased tensions in the region. A pro-NATO, anti-Russia nation on Russia's eastern border, controlling Russia's sole access point to the Black Sea, was a major concern for the Kremlin. Even after the annexation of Crimea, the US-Ukraine relationship continued to develop, with a focus on arming Ukraine and exacerbating differences between Ukraine and Russia. Although Ukraine was not yet a member of NATO, the groundwork was being laid for its eventual membership. For Russia, rather than waiting for Ukraine to join NATO and risk World War III, the decision was made to invade before it was too late. Putin had an, “apocalyptic vision of a future, nuclear-armed Ukraine, embedded in NATO and intent on provoking a Russian-Western war. Arguably, it was that long-term nuclear danger that finally prompted Putin to go to war.” (Roberts).\nThe question then remains, why did the US insist on the expansion of NATO? The United States argues that the growth was necessary to counter Russia's expansionary methods and to ensure a hard line against aggression. They claim that with the entrance of countries like Poland and Sweden, even if Russia were to take over Ukraine, NATO's shield would ensure that the hostility stops there. However, Russia's perspective is quite different. They argue that they wouldn't feel the need to invade if NATO weren't getting rid of their buffer zone. They believe that they are being surrounded by enemies, and NATO's expansion is aimed at inciting a Russian invasion.\nWhile NATO clearly didn’t want a Russian invasion, the argument could be made that they are currently fighting a proxy war with the goal of diminishing Russian power. Before the war, the economic threat Russia posed to the US was key. With the increase of hydrofracking in the 2010s, the US took their place as a world gas/oil king. But still, Europe’s largest economy, Germany, had an energy pipeline with Russia running through Ukraine for decades and had plans to build another one. The US considered sanctioning Russian gas but didn't have a solid basis to do so. However, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US imposed sanctions on all gas through the pipeline. A few months later, the pipelines were sabotaged and destroyed, but the responsible party remains unknown. As a result, Germany is now reliant on US gas, which has increased America's power in the world.\nThe ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused immense suffering and loss of life, and it is a clear violation of international law. While Russia's actions must be condemned in the strongest terms, it is important to acknowledge that the situation is more complex than just one of unprovoked aggression. Russia's sense of historical grievances, combined with the power struggle of its leader Vladimir Putin and the expansion of NATO, have all contributed to the current conflict. However, this does not excuse Russia's actions or diminish the responsibility it bears for the suffering it has caused. Additionally, the West's hypocritical condemnation of Russia, given its own history of military interventionism, must also be recognized. Ultimately, there is no justification for the invasion of Ukraine, and both Russia and NATO must be held accountable for their actions and work towards a peaceful resolution.\nWorks Cited\n\nArmstrong, Kathryn. “Ukraine War: Biden to Frame Conflict as Battle for Democracy.” BBC News, BBC, 21 Feb. 2023, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64716380.\nFriedman, Thomas L. “Foreign Affairs; Now a Word from X.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 2 May 1998, https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/02/opinion/foreign-affairs-now-a-word-from-x.html.\nLieven, Anatol. “Crimea Has Become a Frankenstein's Monster.” Foreign Policy, Foreign Policy, 11 Apr. 2023, https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/04/11/crimea-has-become-a-frankensteins-monster/.\nLyshen, Olga. “Ukraine War Reveals 'West versus Rest' Divide, Says Thinktank.” Www.euractiv.com, 22 Feb. 2023, https://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/news/ukraine-war-reveals-west-versus-rest-divide-says-thinktank/.\nPutin, Vladimir. “Article by Vladimir Putin ‘on the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians.’” President of Russia, 12 July 2021, http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66181.\n“Remarks by President Biden on the United Efforts of the Free World to Support the People of Ukraine.” The White House, The United States Government, 26 Mar. 2022, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/03/26/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-united-efforts-of-the-free-world-to-support-the-people-of-ukraine/.\nRoberts, Geoffrey.

    "text": "Education: Neoliberalism's Next Victim\nWritten for EDUC-309: Education and Racialization with Prof. Chenyu Wang on 3/13/2025\nThe 1980s ushered in a global economic revolution, driven by the rise of neoliberalism. The 1979 election of Margaret Thatcher as the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister in 1979, followed by Ronald Reagan’s presidency across the pond a year later, placed two of the world’s superpowers under hyper-conservative, free-market leadership. This decade saw a shift toward trickle-down economics, marked by the vilification of government intervention and the glorification of private industry. Neoliberal politicians championed deregulation and corporate empowerment, encapsulated by Thatcher’s infamous quote, “Economics are the method. The object is to change the soul”. Neoliberalism asserts that the government's role is to actively maintain the existence of a market economy, a sentiment that has found its way into public institutions, including education. By reframing societal success from collective progress to an individual competition, these policies have made everything quantifiable. As a result, a good education has measurable with quantitative barometers for success just like a business.\nAs neoliberalism promoted an individualistic culture, it embedded itself into the structure of public education. Schools were reshaped to function like a competitive marketplace, prioritizing producing high-quality workers over equity and diverse learning. The 1983 report A Nation at Risk was “the opening salvo of the neoliberal education agenda” (Lipman, 46), marking the first of a wave of corporate-backed reports that framed education as a tool for “U.S. economic competitiveness and ‘human capital development’” (Lipman, 46). These reports approached education as a matter-of-fact, results-based industry, looking to standardize public education to make it clear which schools were succeeding and which were failing. In 2002, the neoliberal agenda achieved its crowning jewel when the Bush administration passed the No Child Left Behind law (NCLB).\nNCLB mandated state-administered proficiency tests attached to achievement standards as set by individual states. Schools were required to show year-over-year improvement on these tests, with the threat of disinvestment looming if they fell short of benchmarks. However, these rigid mandates were implemented without accompanying policy measures to support schools in meeting them. As a result, many districts failed, creating “a narrative of unaccountable teachers and schools and unresponsive and change-resistant public institutions” (Lipman, 46). By placing blame on individual teachers, this approach ignored systemic problems such as poor resource management, outside-community imposed curricula, segregation, and broader structural poverty and racial inequality.\nThe market-driven response of education was a focus on charter schools, often staffed by non-unionized teachers allowing administrators to easily punish educators they deemed inadequate and offer “merit pay” to those who met their expectations. This transformed small and charter schools into “instruments of the market” (Lipman, 47), representing competition for the “status quo” of public schools. Corporate actors began getting directly involved in the education system, embracing the capitalistic assumption that competition breeds quality, further entrenching neoliberal ideology in the public education sector.\nOne of the first great neoliberal experiments in education emerged in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Seeing opportunity in disaster, President George W. Bush declared the Gulf Coast a “taxpayer subsidized ‘enterprise zone’”, using the crisis to “implement the free market fundamentalism that is not yet politically palatable in the rest of the country’” (Lipman, 48). The city quickly restored tourist and middle class areas while privatizing public services. The state-funded gentrification of historically poor Black areas, seizing public housing in these communities and converting it into market rate developments.\nThe final nail in the coffin for this shift came with the privatization of the city’s public schools. The state took control of 100 public schools and transferred them to private organizations, and in the process, “fired all 4,500 public school teachers, broke the city’s powerful Black-led teachers’ union, and dismantled the school system’s administrative infrastructure” (Lipman, 49). In the years following Katrina, the Department of Education invested over $60-million to open charter schools in Louisiana. Between 2006 and 2007, 31 of the 55 newly opened schools in New Orleans were charter, compared to just five before the disaster. This sweeping privatization effort was headed “by fiat by the governor, guided by think tanks such as the Urban Institute and backed by corporate foundations such as the Gates Foundation” (Lipman, 49). As a result, public school enrollment in New Orleans plummeted from 63,000 students before Katrina to just 24,000 afterwards.\nThe underlying goal of this reconstruction was clear: to create a whiter, middle-class, more “capital and developed friendly” New Orleans (Lipman, 50). This wasn’t hidden, with the Director of Housing and Urban Development Alphonso Jackson saying “New Orleans is not going to be as black as it was for a long time, if ever again,” (Lipman, 50). The neoliberal advocates turned disaster into an opportunity to reshape public education in favor of corporate interests.\nChicago’s Ren2010 plan also advocated for a a neoliberal marketplace of schooling. The original proposal was to replace 60 Chicago public schools with 100 new ones, ⅓ charter, ⅓ contract, and ⅓ performance schools– schools operating under five-year performance contracts contingent on meeting performance barometers. Following protests, the city opted not to relocate students but instead replace all teachers and administrators of schools that didn't meet their criteria. Additionally, the city elected to consolidate and phase out low enrollment schools on the grounds of improving “efficiency” and “cost effectiveness” (Lipman, 51).\nThis created direct relationship between education and market, as “the stage for Ren2010 was set by an accountability regime that normalized labeling, sorting, and classifying schools, and meting out penalties without regard for inequities in resources, opportunity to learn, teachers’ ideologies, cultural marginalization in curriculum and instruction, the social context of the school, or the strengths children bring to the school setting.” (Lipman, 52). Ren2010 allowed the city to easily classify schools as good or bad, and, instead of helping the “bad” schools improve, allow the city to take them over and privatize them.\nHowever, the schools most at-risk were identifiable before the policy came into practice. Decades of structural divestestment of these institutions set them up to fail under this policy, resulting in privatized education in low-income, minority communities compared to selective enrollment public schools in gentrified areas. Public schools, previously anchors for communities, were set to fail, with charter schools recruiting their students, putting them at higher risk of losing funding due to low enrollment. The overall goal of Ren2010 was clear: the full-scale privatization of education.\nMarket-driven education has created competition not only between schools but also students. As shown in The Lottery, students must compete in a lottery for limited selection to charter schools. This results in a self-fulfilling prophecy: those who get chosen receive a “good” education, while the rest are resigned to underfunded public schools and likely staying in poverty.\nThe Education Freedom Act, passed in Tennessee earlier this year, shows this at play. The law established a scholarship program allowing qualified students to receive vouchers to attend private school instead of their zoned public schools (Kent). Rather than investing in improving universal public education for all students, this system allows middle- and upper-class students to benefit from either a strong public education or to pay for private alternatives, while only the “best” low-income students are honored with quality education.\nAdditionally, since the students that test well are the ones who get the vouchers for private schools, they will leave struggling public schools and further decrease the district’s performance. This results in a two-tiered education system based on a state-created market where private schools are synonymous with quality, public schools with failure, and little room for movement.\nWhile market-driven education policies have commodified schooling, they’ve also centered “good education” as productivity-centered. The Trump administration has been at the forefront of this with its war on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). The anti-DEI agenda is a two front war with attacks based in both cultural and economic opposition.\nCulturally, conservatives have framed DEI as a discriminatory practice that simply blames White people for the world’s problems and attacks White identity. They take offense to any idea of America as a structurally inequitable nation and view policies that address fundamental inequalities between people as inherently anti-American. As part of their anti-DEI movement, the Trump administration has sought to attack schools that teach “divisive ideologies” and “indoctrination”, calling these teachings “illegal discriminatory practices at institutions of learning.” (Schools…).\nEconomically, conservative policy makers have framed their opposition to DEI in a way that appeals to the neoliberal, establishment base that Republicans have formed since Reagan. At its core, they argue, DEI is an unproductive learning style. They contest that social sciences and humanities are not tangible, skill-based topics and do not improve students’ ability to compete in the job market. Contrastly, STEM and business curricula promote valuable skills that can immediately give students the leg up on their peers and create more productive workers. For those who struggle with STEM or business classes, vocational-technical schools—offering direct job training in trades like electricity and plumbing—are the next best option.\nThe late comedian George Carlin captured this sentiment: “They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking…They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table to figure out how badly they’re getting f–ked by a system…They want obedient workers” (Goodreads). Identifying America’s systemic failures does not create more jobs, but threatens the neoliberal economy and is inherently inefficient.\nWhile DEI faces resistance, neoliberalism selectively embraces diversity when it can be used. Diversity as a commodity that can be monetized and marketed rather than a lived experience is an incredibly valuable tool for neoliberal education. The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley positioned itself as the first bilingual university. They promoted the Spanish language as an economic asset that can be commodified instead of a cultural identity held by human beings. This practice of converse racialization rebranded the language as a neutral tool, not linked with any group of people, aligned with market values. It inherently shifted language from being a cultural expression to a tool for economic competition. (Mena & Garcia).\nAs neoliberalism shapes education policy, the consequences of treating schools as corporations become clear. A fully marketized and privatized education system will mirror the modern economy: one of deep inequality, where those born into privilege receive quality education and only the luckiest few achieve social mobility. Thatcher’s assertion that, “Economics are the method. The object is to change the soul” will have, in turn, been realized.\nNeoliberalism has spent the past half-century casting private corporations as the bastions of progress and the government as standing in the way of the future. It has transformed the public perception of government from something that should uplift and provide a foundation into something that should operate with efficiency. Housing, labor unions, and environmental protections have already fallen in the name of the free-market, and education is just the next frontier in this cultural and economic takeover.\nThis is no longer just a political issue; but a cultural reckoning. Without a radical change to the way Americans perceive the government’s role and movement from neoliberalism’s manufactured measures of success, America will continue to move further from the meritocracy neoliberals pretend we have and into the oligarchy their actions have constructed.\nReferences\nGoodreads.
