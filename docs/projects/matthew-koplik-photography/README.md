# Matthew Koplik Photography Online Store

**By Adam Koplik**

## Overview  
I built and currently manage an e-commerce website for my brother's photography business, selling fine art landscape and nature prints. Beyond setting up the storefront, I've handled full operational management of the online store, including pricing strategy, custom product configurations, marketing, order fulfillment, and customer service.

## Project Scope  

- Developed a custom Shopify storefront for photography prints and framed artwork.
- Implemented **custom HTML and CSS** to modify the store's theme, product pages, and checkout experience beyond Shopify's default settings.
- Used **Easify Product Options** to create interactive product selectors for print sizes, framing options, and material types.
- Designed and executed a multi-tier **pricing strategy** based on production and framing costs.
- Managed **order fulfillment logistics**, including vendor partnerships, drop shipping arrangements, and customer communication.
- Built and ran **email marketing campaigns**, **social media ads**, and a content strategy to support product launches.
- Configured integrated Shopify apps for inventory management, order tracking, and performance analytics.

## Tools and Technologies  

- Shopify  
- Custom HTML & CSS (Liquid theme modifications and in-page custom code)
- Easify Product Options  
- Canva (promotional content)  
- Instagram, Facebook, and email marketing  
- Excel for pricing models and sales tracking

## Results  

- Launched the full store and product catalog in under two weeks.
- Developed a multi-tier pricing structure with upsell and cross-sell options.
- Increased average order value by customizing product options and offering framing add-ons.
- Built and maintained an active social media presence and subscriber base for email marketing.

## Takeaways  

This project gave me hands-on experience not just with Shopify's backend, but also with customizing front-end design and functionality using HTML and CSS. It taught me how to optimize a store's layout, product display logic, and checkout flow to create a more personalized and effective customer experience. It also gave me practical experience in pricing strategy, operational logistics, and digital marketing for an e-commerce business.
