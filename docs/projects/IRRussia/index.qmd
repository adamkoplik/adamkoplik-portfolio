# With(out) Reason: Why Russia Invaded Ukraine*
*Written for **GOVT-114W: International Relations** with Prof. Alan Cafruny on 4/14/2023*

*ABSTRACT:* This paper examines the root causes of Russia\'s military
intervention in Ukraine, which has been widely condemned as an illegal
act of aggression. While many attribute the invasion to Vladimir
Putin\'s authoritarianism, this paper argues that the situation is far
more complex. The paper identifies historical grievances, NATO
expansion, and domestic political instability in Russia as key factors
that led to the conflict. These factors create a complex web of tensions
and motivations that complicate efforts to assign blame or find a
resolution. Overall, this paper seeks to provide a more nuanced
understanding of the conflict and its underlying causes.

On February 24, 2022, Russia ended a decades-long European peace with
the invasion of Ukraine. Immediately, the Western world condemned Putin
and his nation, claiming the invasion was a product of his tyranny. Over
the past 14 months, Western opinion on the war hasn't shifted, getting
even more intense. President Joe Biden said in February, that the United
States is "in the great battle for freedom: a battle between democracy
and autocracy, between liberty and repression, between a rules-based
order and one governed by brute force" ("Remarks by President
Biden...\"). Around the same time, Putin shifted the war's blame onto
the west, saying "I want to repeat: it is they who are culpable for the
war, and we are using force to stop it" (Armstrong). So, who is right?
Who is truly to blame for the war? In reality, there is no clear answer,
but a mixture of blame to go around.

The history of the region between Russia and Ukraine can be traced back
to the Soviet era, when the two nations were part of the Soviet Union.
After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Ukraine gained independence
and became a sovereign nation, but tensions with Russia persisted,
particularly over the status of Crimea, which has a significant
Russian-speaking population. Although Crimea was made part of Ukraine
during the Soviet era, Russia annexed the territory after a Ukrainian
coup that installed a Western-backed leader. The annexation of Crimea in
2014 was viewed as a violation of Ukraine\'s territorial sovereignty and
sparked ongoing conflict in the region. The strategic importance of
Crimea, which houses Russia\'s main naval base and provides access to
the Black Sea, has made the conflict particularly contentious. The
tensions escalated over the past decade, leading to a sort of civil war
between pro-Russian separatist groups and Ukrainian loyalists,
culminating in the recent full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

In Putin's "On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians", he
breaks down the ethnic and historical similarities between the Russian
and Ukrainian people, linking them to the same lineage. He argues that
the two nations are one people, noting that the two countries were
historically part of the same state with many shared traditions and
values. He implies that Western nations like the United States seek to
use Ukraine as a geopolitical pawn while also expressing concern for the
treatment of ethnic Russians in Ukrainian territories (Putin). While
this concern has been scoffed at by the West, recent comments by
Ukrainian Senior Advisor Mykhailo Podolyak support Putin's analysis,
saying "We have to eradicate everything Russian. There should be only
Ukrainian cultural space or global cultural space. We should not have a
dialogue about whether a person has the right to use the Russian
language or not" (Lieven). These comments by Podolyak are indicative of
the views of far-right nationalists that hold high roles in the
Ukrainian government. Many fear that these hard-liners, who hold
significant influence and power, could prove to be a formidable obstacle
to bringing an end to the war.

Russia portrays the ongoing war as being fueled in part by historical
grievances, while the United States attributes its cause to the
tyrannical nature of Vladimir Putin. According to the Western narrative,
Putin\'s grip on power was being threatened by a faltering economy and
diminishing global influence. In response, he launched an invasion of
Ukraine in the hopes of securing a swift victory and rallying support at
home while expanding Russia\'s territory. Many have drawn parallels
between his aims and the expansionist policies of the former Soviet
Union. As President Biden has stated, this is a battle between autocracy
and democracy, reminiscent of the ideological justifications for proxy
wars during the Cold War, such as Vietnam and Korea.

A key difference between the current situation and the Cold War era is
that the rest of the world is not necessarily on board with the Western
perspective. In countries such as China, India, and Turkey, between
69-79% of people view Russia as a strategic ally, and a significant
portion believe that ending the war should be the highest priority, even
if it means significant concessions on the part of Ukraine (Lyshen). By
contrast, the US has taken a hard-line stance on the conflict. When
viewed in such stark terms, there is little room for nuance or
compromise. The Biden administration sees the conflict as a battle
between good and evil, with no room for negotiation or compromise with
the perceived forces of evil.

The final and possibly most important cause of the war is the expansion
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or NATO. Since its creation in
the 40s, NATO has been America's most important alliance, but many have
warned against its expansion. In 1998, former US director of policy
planning George Kennan said about NATO's expansion, "\'I think it is the
beginning of a new cold war...I think it is a tragic mistake. There was
no reason for this whatsoever. No one was threatening anybody else. This
expansion would make the Founding Fathers of this country turn over in
their graves." (Friedman). Kennan's criticisms were echoed by CIA
Director William Burns in a leaked embassy cable saying, "NATO
enlargement, particularly to Ukraine...could potentially split the
country in two, leading to violence or even, some claim, civil war,
which would force Russia to decide whether to intervene." ("Submit
Documents...").

As NATO has expanded over the years, Russia has grown increasingly wary
of American interference in its sphere of influence. The US-led
invasions of Serbia, Iraq, and Libya, all conducted under the backing of
NATO, set off alarm bells in the Kremlin. Moreover, the US\'s withdrawal
from the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty and the Iran Nuclear Deal
have only fueled Russian distrust of the United States. From the Russian
perspective, America is an expansionist power that cannot be negotiated
with or trusted. They see the US as being incapable of honoring
agreements, with no checks or balances or ability to be policed by the
world.

The expansion of NATO to the east began to terrify Russia, especially
after Ukraine\'s 2014 coup, which increased tensions in the region. A
pro-NATO, anti-Russia nation on Russia\'s eastern border, controlling
Russia\'s sole access point to the Black Sea, was a major concern for
the Kremlin. Even after the annexation of Crimea, the US-Ukraine
relationship continued to develop, with a focus on arming Ukraine and
exacerbating differences between Ukraine and Russia. Although Ukraine
was not yet a member of NATO, the groundwork was being laid for its
eventual membership. For Russia, rather than waiting for Ukraine to join
NATO and risk World War III, the decision was made to invade before it
was too late. Putin had an, "apocalyptic vision of a future,
nuclear-armed Ukraine, embedded in NATO and intent on provoking a
Russian-Western war. Arguably, it was that long-term nuclear danger that
finally prompted Putin to go to war." (Roberts).

The question then remains, why did the US insist on the expansion of
NATO? The United States argues that the growth was necessary to counter
Russia\'s expansionary methods and to ensure a hard line against
aggression. They claim that with the entrance of countries like Poland
and Sweden, even if Russia were to take over Ukraine, NATO\'s shield
would ensure that the hostility stops there. However, Russia\'s
perspective is quite different. They argue that they wouldn\'t feel the
need to invade if NATO weren\'t getting rid of their buffer zone. They
believe that they are being surrounded by enemies, and NATO\'s expansion
is aimed at inciting a Russian invasion.

While NATO clearly didn't want a Russian invasion, the argument could be
made that they are currently fighting a proxy war with the goal of
diminishing Russian power. Before the war, the economic threat Russia
posed to the US was key. With the increase of hydrofracking in the
2010s, the US took their place as a world gas/oil king. But still,
Europe's largest economy, Germany, had an energy pipeline with Russia
running through Ukraine for decades and had plans to build another one.
The US considered sanctioning Russian gas but didn\'t have a solid basis
to do so. However, after Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine, the US imposed
sanctions on all gas through the pipeline. A few months later, the
pipelines were sabotaged and destroyed, but the responsible party
remains unknown. As a result, Germany is now reliant on US gas, which
has increased America\'s power in the world.

The ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused immense suffering and
loss of life, and it is a clear violation of international law. While
Russia\'s actions must be condemned in the strongest terms, it is
important to acknowledge that the situation is more complex than just
one of unprovoked aggression. Russia\'s sense of historical grievances,
combined with the power struggle of its leader Vladimir Putin and the
expansion of NATO, have all contributed to the current conflict.
However, this does not excuse Russia\'s actions or diminish the
responsibility it bears for the suffering it has caused. Additionally,
the West\'s hypocritical condemnation of Russia, given its own history
of military interventionism, must also be recognized. Ultimately, there
is no justification for the invasion of Ukraine, and both Russia and
NATO must be held accountable for their actions and work towards a
peaceful resolution.
